The most common tokens in the text occured from 7-9 times, while there was 40 sentences in the text. I believe that the common tokens appearing in the same sentences accounts for the fact that the most common token score was so low. "

    "- Again, the most common score from the article was 0-0.03. I still think this is due to the fact that the most common lemmas did not occur in the text at a high proportion compared to the number of sentences. This could also be due to common lemmas occuring in the same sentences as one another. I also noticed that there weren't really any sentences with high lemma scores, and I believe this is due to the author writing very long sentences throughout the text and diluting the scores of each sentence.

Create a summary of the article by going through every sentence in the article and adding it to an (initially) empty list if its score (based on tokens) is greater than the cutoff score you identified in question 8.

      "John Denton This story was excerpted from John Denton's Cardinals Beat newsletter. The Cardinals did finally snag Gray -- a player they coveted for years and had tried unsuccessfully to deal for in the past -- but they took a decidedly different path in filling out the rotation. The question now, of course, is this: Did the Cardinals do enough to patch a pitching staff that left its fingerprints all over the franchise’s worst season in 33 years in 2023? Gray is already injured , and Lynn and Gibson have looked shaky this spring. If Lynn and Gibson can’t stabilize the staff and stay healthy, can the Cards avoid a similar fate in 2024? The starting staff must get -- and stay -- healthy With a very difficult start to the season, the Cardinals' revamped pitching staff will be put to the test right away. Sonny Gray Despite Gray’s right hamstring injury, he impressed the club with his strong communication skills and his gameplanning. Bold prediction Cards will win the NL Central Simply returning to the postseason will be a major accomplishment considering that the Cards finished last in the division in 2023.\n"

Create a summary of the article by going through every sentence in the article and adding it to an (initially) empty list if its score (based on lemmas) is greater than the cutoff score you identified in question 8.

      "What if they lured Aaron Nola out of Philadelphia, finally closed the deal on Sonny Gray and traded for Tyler Glasnow? Both wanted to be Cardinals, and the franchise fulfilled those desires even though both had rocky ERAs from the previous season. The question now, of course, is this: Did the Cardinals do enough to patch a pitching staff that left its fingerprints all over the franchise’s worst season in 33 years in 2023? Gray is already injured , and Lynn and Gibson have looked shaky this spring. If Lynn and Gibson can’t stabilize the staff and stay healthy, can the Cards avoid a similar fate in 2024? The starting staff must get -- and stay -- healthy With a very difficult start to the season, the Cardinals' revamped pitching staff will be put to the test right away. However, they won’t be able to support the staff without healthy and productive seasons from Gray, Lynn, Gibson and Matz. Gorman was limited to 119 games last season because of back trouble, and he still led the Redbirds with 27 homers. Sonny Gray Despite Gray’s right hamstring injury, he impressed the club with his strong communication skills and his gameplanning. He will bring some much-needed toughness and fire to the staff.\n"

It seems that the sentences containing the most common tokens seemed to include several sentences with a more negative outlook, but there was also as many sentences that I would consider positive.

The token score summary is easier to read, and I think it better captures the story that the original article was trying to tell. The token score summary that was generated also had a closer polarity score to the original article, so I think that also points to the fact that it better captured the sentiment of the article. "

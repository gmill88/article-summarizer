      "John Denton This story was excerpted from John Denton's Cardinals Beat newsletter. The Cardinals did finally snag Gray -- a player they coveted for years and had tried unsuccessfully to deal for in the past -- but they took a decidedly different path in filling out the rotation. The question now, of course, is this: Did the Cardinals do enough to patch a pitching staff that left its fingerprints all over the franchise’s worst season in 33 years in 2023? Gray is already injured , and Lynn and Gibson have looked shaky this spring. If Lynn and Gibson can’t stabilize the staff and stay healthy, can the Cards avoid a similar fate in 2024? The starting staff must get -- and stay -- healthy With a very difficult start to the season, the Cardinals' revamped pitching staff will be put to the test right away. Sonny Gray Despite Gray’s right hamstring injury, he impressed the club with his strong communication skills and his gameplanning. Bold prediction Cards will win the NL Central Simply returning to the postseason will be a major accomplishment considering that the Cards finished last in the division in 2023.\n"

Create a summary of the article by going through every sentence in the article and adding it to an (initially) empty list if its score (based on lemmas) is greater than the cutoff score you identified in question 8.

      "The question now, of course, is this: Did the Cardinals do enough to patch a pitching staff that left its fingerprints all over the franchise’s worst season in 33 years in 2023? If Lynn and Gibson can’t stabilize the staff and stay healthy, can the Cards avoid a similar fate in 2024? The starting staff must get -- and stay -- healthy With a very difficult start to the season, the Cardinals' revamped pitching staff will be put to the test right away. However, they won’t be able to support the staff without healthy and productive seasons from Gray, Lynn, Gibson and Matz. For as much talk as there has been about the revamped starting staff, the Cardinals also worked to turn over their bullpen mix. Sonny Gray Despite Gray’s right hamstring injury, he impressed the club with his strong communication skills and his gameplanning. He will bring some much-needed toughness and fire to the staff.\n"
